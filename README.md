# Crisicle
2-D Game

The game  „Crisicle“ is an endless, score (time) based 2-D Game. 

The goal is rather simple - run for as long as you can. The twist is that there are holes in the floor and if you (your character) fall into one of them, it‘s Game Over.

Now, of course, you are not optionless, you can keep the character alive by stuffing these holes with icicles that happen to conveniently be placed right above these holes. All you have to do to make them drop and thereby allow your character to live is click/tap them 3 times. Not too hard, right?

Give it a try. (Link will be added when available.)
